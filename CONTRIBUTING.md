We’re releasing the source code with the explicit intention of allowing contributions. The coordination of the project lies with the development team of the European Digital Identity Progam, but we’re open to all contributions. You can directly create a new Pull Request via Github,or contact the community manager via [edi@minbzk.nl](mailto:edi@minbzk.nl).

The development team works on the repository in a private fork (for reasons of compliance with existing processes) and shares its work as often as possible. If you watch the repository on GitHub, you will be notified of a new release. We will also send a notification through Pleio.

Although we are open to contributions, please consider the nature of this project as outlined in this Readme. At this stage the most useful way to contribute to the project is to participate on our community site [edi.pleio.nl](https://edi.pleio.nl), and visit our [EDI Meet-ups and/or Heartbeats](https://edi.pleio.nl/events). 

If you plan to make non-trivial changes, we recommend that you open an issue beforehand where we can discuss your planned changes. This increases the chance that we might be able to use your contribution (or it avoids doing work if there are reasons why we wouldn't be able to use it).

Note that all commits should be signed using a GPG key.
